# Trail: Graphical User Interfaces

How do you write a program in the Java programming language with
a graphical user interface? The short answer — the Swing toolkit!
This trail gives you a brief overview of the graphical capabilities of
the core Java platform with a special focus on Swing.

This trail, part of `The Java Tutorial`, does not show
how to implement these features.
For a "how-to" on using the Swing toolkit, see
[Creating a GUI With JFC/Swing](../uiswing/index.html).

**A Brief Introduction to Swing**](overview/index.html)
provides a high-level table of the capabilities provided by
the Swing toolkit and other Java Foundation Classes.
A demo is provided that showcases many of these capabilities.

**Swing Features**](features/index.html) explains the basic features of
Swing, such as drag and drop, internationalization, pluggable
look and feel, and provides a visual list of the components
available in the Swing toolkit.
