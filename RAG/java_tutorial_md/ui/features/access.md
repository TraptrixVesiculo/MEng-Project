# Accessibility

Assistive technologies exist to enable people with permanent or temporary
disabilities to use the computer. This includes a wide variety of
techniques and equipment — voice interfaces, magnifiers, screen readers,
closed captioning, keyboard enhancements, and so on.
In many countries, including the United States, Australia,
Canada, and the European Union, there are laws requiring
that programs function smoothly with assistive technologies.
For more information, see
[Oracle's Accessibility Program](http://www.oracle.com/accessibility/index.html).

A certain level of accessibility is built-in to all Swing components,
but full accessibility can be achieved by following some simple rules.
For example, assign tool tips, keyboard alternatives,
and textual descriptions for images, wherever possible.

The PasswordStore demo follows the rules set out for accessibility.
In the following figure, you can see an example of tool tip text.
