# Integrating with the Desktop

The
[`Desktop API`](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/Desktop.html), introduced in version 6 of the Java Platform,
Standard Edition (Java SE), enables Java applications to
integrate seamlessly with the desktop. Three types of
integration are supported:

* The ability to launch the host system's default browser with a specific
  Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).* The ability to launch the host system's default email client.* The ability to launch applications to open, edit, or print files
      associated with those applications.

You can see this in the PasswordStore demo in the Notes text pane.
Click on the link that is displayed in the text pane — it opens
the specified URI in the default browser.

![This is a picture of the PasswordStore demo showing a URI in the text pane.](../../figures/ui/ui-URIPasswordStore.png)

Click on the URI and it opens in the Default Browser

[Using the Desktop API in Java SE 6](http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2SE/Desktop/javase6/desktop_api/) article.
