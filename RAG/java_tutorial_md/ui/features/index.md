# Lesson: Swing Features

PasswordStore shows some of the rich functionality of
a particular Swing application.
This lesson discusses the general features available to applications
using the Java SE platform and, in particular, the Swing toolkit.

### [A Visual Guide to Swing Components (Java Look and Feel)](components.html)

> Swing is primarily known for its rich set of GUI components.
> This section provides a visual menu of Swing's components,
> grouped by type, using the Java look and feel.

### [A Visual Guide to Swing Components (Windows Look and Feel)](compWin.html)

> This page shows the same components, using the Windows look and feel.

### [Pluggable Look and Feel](plaf.html)

> The pluggable look and feel architecture allows a program to
> have control over its appearance. This section describes
> what options are available to the programmer.

### [Data Transfer](dnd.html)

> Most programs will want to use drag and drop or cut, copy and paste.
> This section talks a bit about data transfer and what is implemented
> for you.

### [Internationalization and Localization](i18n.html)

> Internationalizing an application makes it easy to tailor it to the
> customs and languages of end users around the world. This section
> describes the difference between internationalization and localization.

### [Accessibility](access.html)

> Making your program accessible means that it can be used, without
> modification, by anyone with permanent or temporary disabilities
> who may require special devices. And, in many countries,
> making programs accessible is the law.

### [Integrating with the Desktop](desktop.html)

> An application that is well integrated with the desktop will,
> where appropriate, allow the user to launch the default mail application
> or internet browser, pre-populating text fields as needed.
> It will also allow the user to launch another application to open, edit or
> print a file associated with that application.

### [System Tray Icon Support](tray.html)

> Some platforms, such as Microsoft Windows, feature a system tray
> on the desktop. As of version 6 of the Java SE, your application
> can now add a tray icon to the system tray.
