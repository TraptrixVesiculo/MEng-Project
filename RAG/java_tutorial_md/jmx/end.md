## What next?

Once you've caught your breath,
you have several choices of where to go next.
You can go to the [front page](../index.html)
to see all of your choices,
or you can go directly to one of the following related trails:

The purpose of this trail has been to provide you with a brief introduction to the basic elements of the JMX technology. More advanced materials can be found elsewhere.

The following resources will be useful if you wish to study the JMX technology further:

* [JMX Technology documentation for the Java SE Platform](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jmx/index.html). The JMX Technology documentation is included in the
  [Java SE platform documentation set](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/).
* [JMX Technology Overview](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jmx/overview/JMXoverviewTOC.html). The Java SE platform documentation for the JMX technology contains the JMX Technology Overview, which provides a more detailed description of the JMX Technology than is provided in the present trail.
* [JMX Technology Tutorial](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jmx/tutorial/tutorialTOC.html). The lessons in this trail are based on the examples used in the JMX Technology Tutorial. In addition to the basic elements presented in the present trail, the JMX Technology Tutorial presents more advanced aspects of the JMX technology.
* In addition to the examples presented in the above tutorial, once you have installed the Java Development Kit (JDK) 6, a sample application that demonstrates a real-life implementation of the JMX API can be found in the following directory:

  ```

  jdk_home/sample/jmx/jmx-scandir

  ```

  Where `jdk_home` is the directory in which the JDK software is installed. The `jmx-scandir` example is an advanced example, which presents advanced concepts of the JMX API in a real-world scenario.
* [Monitoring and Management for the Java Platform](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/management/). The technologies and APIs provided for the monitoring and management of the Java SE platform rely heavily on the JMX technology. The *Java SE Monitoring and Management Guide* contains a chapter on
  [Monitoring and Management Using JMX Technology](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html).
* [JMX Technology home page](http://java.sun.com/products/JavaManagement/). The JMX technology home page is the place to go for all the latest news about the JMX technology.
