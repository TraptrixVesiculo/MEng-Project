# Putting It All Together

Here, we simulate being, in turn, the `HighScore` developer (Chris),
the `TerrysGame` developer (Terry), and a user (Kim) running the game.

You can execute all the specified steps, and then (as Kim's last step)
run `TerrysGame`.

The steps are presented without explanation. For further
information about the steps that need to be taken by both code
signers (such as Chris and Terry) and receivers of such
code (such as Kim), see the
[Signing Code and Granting It Permissions](../toolsign/index.html)
lesson.

Here are the steps:
