# Save the Policy File

To save the new policy file you've been creating,
choose the **Save As** command from the
**File** menu. This displays the **Save As** dialog box.

The examples in this lesson and in the
[Quick Tour of Controlling Applications](../tour2/index.html)
lesson assume that you stored the policy file in the
`Test` directory on the `C:` drive.

Navigate to the `Test` directory. Type the
file name `mypolicy` and click on **Save**.

The policy file is
now saved, and its name and path are shown in the text box labeled `Policy File`.
