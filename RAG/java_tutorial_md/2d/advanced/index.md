# Lesson: Advanced Topics in Java2D

This lesson shows you how to use `Graphics2D` to display graphics with
fancy outline and fill styles, transform graphics when they are
rendered, constrain rendering to a particular area, and generally
control the way graphics look when they are rendered. You'll also learn
how to create complex `Shape` objects by combining simple ones and how to
detect when the user clicks on a displayed graphics primitive. These
topics are discussed in the following sections:

## [Transforming Shapes, Text, and Images](transforming.html)

This section shows you how to modify the default transformation so that
objects are translated, rotated, scaled, or sheared when they are
rendered.

## [Clipping the Drawing Region](clipping.html)

You can use any shape as a *clipping path*--the
area within which rendering takes place.

## [Compositing Graphics](compositing.html)

This section illustrates the various compositing styles supported by
`AlphaComposite` and shows you how to set the compositing
style in the `Graphics2D` rendering context.

## [Controlling Rendering Quality](quality.html)

This section describes the rendering hints that `Graphics2D`
supports and shows you how to specify your preference in the trade-off
between rendering quality and speed.

## [Constructing Complex Shapes from Geometry Primitives](complexshapes.html)

This section shows you how to perform boolean operations on `Shape`
objects using the `Area` class.

## [Supporting User Interaction](user.html)

This section shows you how to perform hit detection on graphics primitives.
