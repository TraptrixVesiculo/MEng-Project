# Trail: 2D Graphics

This trail introduces you to the Java 2D™ API and shows you how to display
and print 2D graphics in your Java programs. The trail is intended for
developers who want to enrich their knowledge of the Java 2D API, as well
as for beginners in computer graphics. Almost every section contains
relevant examples to illustrate specific capabilities. The Java 2D API
enables you to easily perform the following tasks:

* Draw lines, rectangles and any other geometric shape.* Fill those shapes with solid colors or gradients and textures.* Draw text with options for fine control over the font and rendering process.* Draw images, optionally applying filtering operations.* Apply operations such as compositing and transforming during any of the above rendering operations.

This chapter also explains less familiar concepts
such as compositing.

*Using 2D Graphics API to display complex charts*

*Using image-filtering operations*

This chapter describes the concept of drawing on-screen and off-screen images,
as well as surfaces and printer devices. This trail covers the most common uses
of the Java 2D APIs and briefly describes some of the more advanced features.

**Overview of the Java 2D Graphics API**](overview/index.html)
introduces the key Java 2D concepts and describes the Java 2D rendering model.
This lesson is more conceptual than other lessons of this trail, it enables you
to get deep into basic notions and classes descriptions.

[![Trail icon](../images/coreIcon.gif)
**Getting started with Graphics**](basic2d/index.html)
uses a developed example to show you how to obtain a Graphics object and use
it for common graphics rendering tasks.

[![Trail icon](../images/coreIcon.gif)
**Working with Geometry**](geometry/index.html)
teaches you how to use APIs to draw graphic primitives and arbitrary shapes, and
how to apply fancy strokes and fill styles.

[![Trail icon](../images/coreIcon.gif)
**Working with Text APIs**](text/index.html)
shows you how to effectively use text APIs, including how to create a `Font`
object with desired attributes, measure text, and determine the names of the
fonts available on your system.

[![Trail icon](../images/coreIcon.gif)
**Working with Images**](images/index.html)
explains how to create a BufferedImage object, perform image-filtering operations,
and draw on an image.

[![Trail icon](../images/coreIcon.gif)
**Printing**](printing/index.html)
teaches you how to render 2D graphics to a printer, print complex documents,
and use Print Services.

[![Trail icon](../images/coreIcon.gif)
**Advanced topics in Java 2D**](advanced/index.html)
explains how to perform transformations, clip the drawing region, composite
overlapping graphics, specify rendering preferences, and control rendering
quality.
