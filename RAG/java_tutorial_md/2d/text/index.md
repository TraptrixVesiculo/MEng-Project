# Lesson: Working with Text APIs

This lesson introduces you to the concept of working with text API’s to
apply text rendering capabilities. Already in this trail, you have used basic
Java 2D™ text APIs and know how to set a font and position, and how to draw text.

This lesson expands on that material to help you develop an understanding of
how to use those APIs and moves further into the capabilities
of Java 2D text display.

These topics are discussed in the following sections.

[Selecting a font](fonts.html)
:   This section explains how to use the methods of the `Font` class to determine
    which fonts are available on your system, to create a `Font` object, and
    obtain information about a font family.

[Measuring Text](measuringtext.html)
:   This section explains how to properly measure text by using an instance of the
    `FontMetrics` class.

[Advanced Text Display](advanced.html)
:   This section explains how to position and render a paragraph of
    styled text, how to display antialiased text, and how to use text attributes
    to style text.
