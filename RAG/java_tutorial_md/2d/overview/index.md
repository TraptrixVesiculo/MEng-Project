# Lesson: Overview of the Java 2D API Concepts

The Java 2D™ API provides two-dimensional
graphics, text, and imaging capabilities for Java™ programs
through extensions to the Abstract Windowing Toolkit (AWT). This comprehensive
rendering package supports line art, text, and images in a flexible,
full-featured framework for developing richer user interfaces, sophisticated
drawing programs, and image editors. Java 2D objects exist on a plane called
user coordinate space, or just [*user space*](coordinate.html). When objects are rendered on a screen
or a printer, user space coordinates are transformed to [*device space coordinates*](coordinate.html). The following links are useful to start learning about the Java 2D API:

* [`Graphics`](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/Graphics.html) class* [`Graphics2D`](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/Graphics2D.html) class

The Java 2D API provides following capabilities:

* A uniform rendering model for display devices and printers* A wide range of geometric primitives, such as curves, rectangles, and
    ellipses, as well as a mechanism for rendering virtually any geometric shape* Mechanisms for performing hit detection on shapes, text, and images* A compositing model that provides control over how overlapping objects are rendered* Enhanced color support that facilitates color management* Support for printing complex documents* Control of the quality of the rendering through the use of rendering hints

These topics are discussed in the following sections:

* [Java 2D Rendering](rendering.html)* [Geometric Primitives](primitives.html)* [Text](text.html)* [Images](images.html)* [Printing](printing.html)
