# Lesson: Working with Geometry

In prior lessons, you have learned the graphics concept, including basic information
about the coordinate system and graphic object creation. Now, you will progress to
more detailed lessons about the 2D graphics classes.
This lesson shows you how to use the
[`Graphics2D`](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/Graphics2D.html) class to draw graphic primitives as well as
arbitrary shapes, and how to display graphics with
fancy outline and fill styles. These topics are discussed in the following
sections.

## [Drawing Geometric Primitives](primitives.html)

This section explains how to create standard shapes such as points, lines,
curves, arcs, rectangles, and ellipses.

## [Drawing Arbitrary Shapes](arbitrary.html)

This section explains how to draw shapes represented by combinations of straight
geometric primitives by using the `GeneralPath` class.

## [Filling and Stroking](strokeandfill.html)

This section explains how to set the stroke and paint attributes to
control the outline and fill styles applied to `Shape` objects and text.
