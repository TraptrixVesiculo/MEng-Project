# Platform-Specific Details: Setting the Proxy Host

You can set the proxy host through the command line. Depending on your
network configuration, you might also need to set the proxy port. If
necessary, ask your system administrator for the name of the proxy host
on your network.

**UNIX**: ``` java -Dhttp.proxyHost=proxyhost [-Dhttp.proxyPort=portNumber] URLReader ``` **DOS shell (Windows 95/NT)**: ``` java -Dhttp.proxyHost=proxyhost [-Dhttp.proxyPort=portNumber] URLReader ```
