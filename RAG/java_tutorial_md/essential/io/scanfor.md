# Scanning and Formatting

Programming I/O often involves translating to and from the neatly
formatted data humans like to work with. To assist you with these
chores, the Java platform provides two APIs. The
[scanner](scanning.html) API breaks input into individual
tokens associated with bits of data. The
[formatting](formatting.html) API assembles data into nicely formatted, human-readable form.
