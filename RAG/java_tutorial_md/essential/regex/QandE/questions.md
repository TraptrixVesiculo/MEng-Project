# Questions and Exercises: Regular Expressions

### Questions

1. What are the three public classes in the `java.util.regex`
   package? Describe the purpose of each.- Consider the string literal `"foo"`. What is the
     start index? What is the end index? Explain what these numbers
     mean.- What is the difference between an ordinary character and a
       metacharacter? Give an example of each.- How do you force a metacharacter to act like an ordinary
         character?- What do you call a set of characters enclosed in square
           brackets? What is it for?- Here are three predefined character classes: `\d`,
             `\s`, and `\w`. Describe each one, and
             rewrite it using square brackets.- For each of `\d`, `\s`, and
               `\w`, write *two* simple expressions that match
               the *opposite* set of characters.- Consider the regular expression `(dog){3}`.
                 Identify the two subexpressions. What string does the expression
                 match?

### Exercises

1. Use a backreference to write an expression that will match a
   person's name only if that person's first name and last name are the same.
