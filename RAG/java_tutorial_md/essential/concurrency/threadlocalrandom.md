# Concurrent Random Numbers

In JDK 7,
[`java.util.concurrent`](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/package-summary.html) includes a convenience class,
[`ThreadLocalRandom`](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ThreadLocalRandom.html), for applications that expect to use random numbers from multiple threads or
`ForkJoinTask`s.

For concurrent access, using
`ThreadLocalRandom` instead of `Math.random()` results in
less contention and, ultimately, better performance.

All you need to do is call `ThreadLocalRandom.current()`, then call
one of its methods to retrieve a random number. Here is one example:

```

int r = ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt(4, 77);

```
