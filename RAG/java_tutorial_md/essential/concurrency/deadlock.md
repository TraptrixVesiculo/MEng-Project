# Deadlock

*Deadlock* describes a situation where two or more threads are blocked
forever, waiting for each other. Here's an example.

Alphonse and Gaston are friends, and great believers in courtesy. A
strict rule of courtesy is that when you bow to a friend, you must
remain bowed until your friend has a chance to return the bow.
Unfortunately, this rule does not account for the possibility that two
friends might bow to each other at the same time. This example
application,
[`Deadlock`](examples/Deadlock.java),
models this possibility:

```


public class Deadlock {
    static class Friend {
        private final String name;
        public Friend(String name) {
            this.name = name;
        }
        public String getName() {
            return this.name;
        }
        public synchronized void bow(Friend bower) {
            System.out.format("%s: %s has bowed to me!%n", 
                    this.name, bower.getName());
            bower.bowBack(this);
        }
        public synchronized void bowBack(Friend bower) {
            System.out.format("%s: %s has bowed back to me!%n",
                    this.name, bower.getName());
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final Friend alphonse = new Friend("Alphonse");
        final Friend gaston = new Friend("Gaston");
        new Thread(new Runnable() {
            public void run() { alphonse.bow(gaston); }
        }).start();
        new Thread(new Runnable() {
            public void run() { gaston.bow(alphonse); }
        }).start();
    }
}

```

When `Deadlock` runs, it's extremely likely that both
threads will block when they attempt to invoke `bowBack`.
Neither block will ever end, because each thread is waiting for the
other to exit `bow`.
