# Thread Objects

Each thread is associated with an instance of the class
[`Thread`](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html).
There are two basic strategies for using `Thread`
objects to create a concurrent application.

* To directly control thread creation and management, simply
  instantiate `Thread` each time the application needs to
  initiate an asynchronous task.* To abstract thread management from the rest of your
    application, pass the application's tasks to an *executor*.

This section documents the use of `Thread` objects.
Executors are discussed with other [high-level
concurrency objects](highlevel.html).
