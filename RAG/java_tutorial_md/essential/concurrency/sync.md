# Synchronization

Threads communicate primarily by sharing access to fields and the
objects reference fields refer to. This form of communication is
extremely efficient, but makes two kinds of errors possible: *thread
interference* and *memory consistency errors*. The tool
needed to prevent these errors is *synchronization*.

* [Thread Interference](interfere.html) describes how errors
  are introduced when multiple threads access shared data.* [Memory Consistency Errors](memconsist.html)
    describes errors that result from inconsistent views of shared
    memory.* [Synchronized Methods](syncmeth.html) describes a
      simple idiom that can effectively prevent thread interference and
      memory consistency errors.* [Implicit Locks and Synchronization](locksync.html)
        describes a more general synchronization idiom, and describes how
        synchronization is based on implicit locks.* [Atomic Access](atomic.html) talks about the general
          idea of operations that can't be interfered with by other threads.
