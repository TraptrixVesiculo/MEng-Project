# Joins

The `join` method allows one thread to wait for the
completion of another. If `t` is a
`Thread` object whose thread is currently executing,

```

t.join();

```

causes the current thread to pause execution until `t`'s
thread terminates. Overloads of `join` allow the programmer
to specify a waiting period. However, as with `sleep`,
`join` is dependent on the OS for timing, so you should not
assume that `join` will wait exactly as long as you
specify.

Like `sleep`, `join` responds to an interrupt by
exiting with an `InterruptedException`.
