# Lesson: Exceptions

The Java programming language uses *exceptions*
to handle errors and other exceptional events. This lesson describes
when and how to use exceptions.

### [What Is an Exception?](definition.html)
:   An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program
    that disrupts the normal flow of instructions.

### [The Catch or Specify Requirement](catchOrDeclare.html)
:   This section covers how to catch and handle exceptions. The discussion
    includes the try, catch, and finally
    blocks, as well as chained exceptions and logging.

### [How to Throw Exceptions](throwing.html)
:   This section covers the throw statement and the
    Throwable class and its subclasses.

### [The try-with-resources Statement](tryResourceClose.html)
:   This section describes the `try`-with-resources statement, which is a `try` statement that declares one or more resources. A resource is as an object that must be closed after the program is finished with it. The `try`-with-resources statement ensures that each resource is closed at the end of the statement.

### [Unchecked Exceptions — The Controversy](runtime.html)
:   This section explains the correct and incorrect use of the unchecked
    exceptions indicated by subclasses of `RuntimeException`.

### [Advantages of Exceptions](advantages.html)
:   The use of exceptions to manage errors has some advantages over
    traditional error-management techniques. You'll learn more in
    this section.
