# Command-Line I/O Objects

`System` provides several predefined I/O objects that are
useful in a Java application that is meant to be launched from the
command line. These implement the Standard I/O streams provided by
most operating systems, and also a console object that is useful for
entering passwords. For more information, refer to
[I/O from the Command Line](../../essential/io/cl.html)
in the
[Basic I/O](../../essential/io/index.html)
lesson.
