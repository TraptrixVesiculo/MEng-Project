# Getting Started with Swing: Examples

#### Compiling and Running the Examples Locally

> The second column in the table below has links to zip files for each
> demo that you can open and run in the NetBeans IDE. Refer to
> [Running Tutorial Examples in NetBeans IDE](../../../information/examples.html) for more information.
>
> If you download an individual example,
> take care to have all the necessary files
> in the proper hierarchy when you compile and run it.
> All of the examples in the Swing tutorial are placed in
> a package. For example, the components examples are placed
> in a `components` package.
> See the following image for the complete structure.
> Note that any examples using images expect their image files
> to be in a directory named `images`
> that is in the same directory as the example's src files.
