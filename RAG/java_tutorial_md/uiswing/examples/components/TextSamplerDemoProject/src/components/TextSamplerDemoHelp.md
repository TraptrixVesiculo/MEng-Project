This is an uneditable `JEditorPane`,
which was *initialized*
with **HTML** text from a
URL.

An editor pane uses specialized editor kits
to read, write, display, and edit text of
different formats.
The Swing text package includes editor kits
for plain text, HTML, and RTF.
You can also develop
custom editor kits for other formats.
