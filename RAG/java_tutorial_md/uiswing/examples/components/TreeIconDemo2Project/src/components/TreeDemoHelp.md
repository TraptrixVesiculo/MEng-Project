# Tree Demo

This is the help file (`TreeDemoHelp.html`)
for the tree demo.
Selecting any branch node in the tree results
in this file being displayed.
When you select a leaf node (a book),
this pane displays an HTML file for that book.

This demo uses a split pane
to separate the tree and this HTML view.
Drag the divider up or down to change the space distribution.
