# Lesson: Getting Started with Swing

[Examples Index](../examples/start/index.html)

This lesson gives you a brief introduction to using the Java Foundation
Classes (JFC) and Swing. After telling you about JFC and Swing,
it helps you get the necessary software and walks you through how to
compile and run a program that uses the Swing packages.

The following lesson,
[Learning Swing with the NetBeans IDE](../learn/index.html), will build on these first steps to help you create several
progressively more complex examples. For now, let's start with the basics.

### [About the JFC and Swing](about.html)

> This section gives you an overview of the JFC and Swing.

### [Compiling and Running Swing Programs](compile.html)

> This section gives you detailed instructions on where to obtain
> the latest JDK and how to
> create, compile and run a program that uses Swing components.
