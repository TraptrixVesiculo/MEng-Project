# Lesson: Using Other Swing Features

[Examples Index](../examples/misc/index.html)

This lesson contains a collection of how-to pages
to help you use miscellaneous Swing features.

### [How to Integrate with the Desktop Class](desktop.html)

> With the `Desktop` class
> you can enable your Java application to interact with default applications
> associated with specific file types on the host platform.

### [How to Create Translucent and Shaped Windows](trans_shaped_windows.html)

> As of the Java Platform, Standard Edition 6 Update 10 release, you can
> add translucent and shaped windows to your Swing applications.
> This lesson shows you how.

### [How to Decorate Components with JLayer](jlayer.html)

> `JLayer` is a flexible and powerful *decorator* for Swing components. It enables
> you to draw on components and respond to component events without modifying
> the underlying component directly.

### [How to Use Actions](action.html)

> With `Action` objects,
> you can coordinate the state and event handling
> of two or more components that generate action events.
> For example, you can use a single `Action`
> to create and coordinate a tool-bar button and a menu item
> that perform the same function.

### [How to Use Swing Timers](timer.html)

> With the Swing `Timer` class,
> you can implement a thread
> that performs an action after a delay,
> and optionally continues to repeat the action.
> The action executes in the event dispatch thread.

### [How to Support Assistive Technologies](access.html)

> Swing components have built-in support for assistive technologies.
> Your program can provide even better support
> by following a few rules.

### [How to Use the Focus Subsystem](focus.html)

> Some programs need to manipulate focus — for example,
> to validate input, or change the tab-order of components.
> This section describes some techniques you can use to
> customize focus in your program.

### [How to Use Key Bindings](keybinding.html)

> With key bindings,
> you can specify how components react to user typing.

### [How to Use Modality in Dialogs](modality.html)

> This section describes a new modality model emerged in the Java™ SE
> version 6 and enables you to apply different modality types to dialog boxes.

### [How to Print Tables](printtable.html)

> This section describes the printing capabilities for tables
> and explains how to add printing support to your programs.

### [How to Print Text](printtext.html)

> This section describes the printing capabilities for text components
> and explains how to add printing support to your programs.

### [How to Create a Splash Screen](splashscreen.html)

> With the `SplashScreen` class you can close the splash screen, change the splash-screen image, obtain the image position or size, and paint in the splash screen.

### [How to Use the System Tray](systemtray.html)

> This section describes how to add a tray icon to the system tray and apply
> a text tooltip, a pop-up menu, ballon messages, and a set of listeners associated with it.

### [Solving Common Problems Using Other Swing Features](problems.html)

> This section tells you how to fix problems you might encounter
> while trying to use the information in this lesson.
