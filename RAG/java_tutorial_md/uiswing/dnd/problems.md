# Solving Common Data Transfer Problems

This section discusses problems that you might encounter when
using data transfer.

**Problem:**
My drag gesture recognizer is not working properly with table/list/tree/text.

Do not use your own drag gesture recognizers with these components.
Use `setDragEnabled(true)` and a
`TransferHandler`.

**Problem:**
I am unable to drop data onto my empty `JTable`.

You need to call `setFillsViewportHeight(true)` on the table. See
[Empty Table Drop](emptytable.html) for more information.
