# Answers: Learning Swing with the NetBeans IDE

### Questions

> Question 1: When creating this new project, we left the "Create Main Class" checkbox deselected. Why?  
> Answer 1: We left this checkbox deselected because the `CelsiusConverterGUI` is the application's
> main entry point.
>   
>   
> Question 2: The \_\_\_\_\_ contains all of the components offered by the Swing API.  
> Answer 2: Palette
>   
>   
> Question 3: What is the purpose of the Design Area?  
> Answer 3: The Design Area is where you visually arrange the various components of the application's GUI.
> It cuts development time because all of the application's layout code is auto-generated.
>   
>   
> Question 4: Explain the difference between the Source and Design tabs.  
> Answer 4: These tabs provide two different views of the same application. The Design tab shows what the application
> actually looks like, and the Source tab shows its source code. Some portions of the source tab are auto-generated and not directly editable by the user.
>   
>   
> Question 5: Name some advantages to editing an object with the Property Editor (as opposed to editing it directly in the source code.)  
> Answer 5: Using the property editor elimates typing errors, accidental modification of the wrong code, and provides a listing
> of all properties exposed by a particular object.
>   
>   
> Question 6:This lesson used Swing objects of three different types. What were they?  
> Answer 6: `JLabel`, `JButton`, and `JTextField`
>   
>   
> Question 7:In the Design Area, describe the process for setting two components to the same width.  
> Answer 7:
> Shift-click the two target components; this will highlight each showing that they are selected. Right-click (control-click for mac users) Same Size -> Same Width. The components will now be the same width.

### Exercises

1. Use the property editor to change the appearance of this application. Experiment by changing some values
   and seeing what effect your changes have. This is a quick and easy way to explore the properties of the various
   Swing components.

Below we've modified the application to use `DialogInput` font, and
have changed the cursor to a hand cursor.
