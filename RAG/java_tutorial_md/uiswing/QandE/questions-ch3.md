# Questions and Exercises: Using Swing Components

> Use the information in this lesson and the component
> [how-to sections](../components/componentlist.html) to help you complete these questions and exercises.

### Questions

> 1. Find the component that best fits each of the following
> needs. Write down both the component’s common name (such
> as “frame”) and find the component's how-to page online.
> [*Hint:* You can use [A
> Visual Index to the Swing Components](../../ui/features/components.html) to help you answer this
> question.]
>
> > a. A component that lets the user pick a color.  
> >   
> > b. A component that displays an icon, but that doesn’t react
> > to user clicks.  
> >   
> > c. A component that looks like a button and that, when pressed,
> > brings up a menu of items for the user to choose from.  
> >   
> > d. A container that looks like a frame, but that appears (usually
> > with other, similar containers) within a real frame.  
> >   
> > e. A container that lets the user determine how two components
> > share a limited amount of space.
>
> 2. Which method do you use to add a menu bar to a top-level
> container such as a `JFrame`?
>
> 3. Which method do you use to specify the default button for
> a top-level container such as a `JFrame` or `JDialog`?
>
> 4. Which method do you use to enable and disable components
> such as `JButton`s? What class is it defined in?
>
> 5. a. Which Swing components use `ListSelectionModel`?
> [*Hint:* The “Use” link at the top of the specification
> for each interface and class takes you to a page showing where
> in the API that interface or class is referenced.]
>
> > b. Do those components use any other models to handle other
> > aspects of the components’ state? If so, list the other
> > models’ types.
>
> 6. Which type of model holds a text component’s content?

### Exercises

> 1. Implement a program with a GUI that looks like the one
> shown below. Put the main method in a class named `MyDemo1`.
>
> > ![MyDemo1.png](../../figures/uiswing/QandE/MyDemo1.png)
>
> 2. Make a copy of `MyDemo1.java` named `MyDemo2.java`.
> Add a menu bar to `MyDemo2`.
>
> 3. Copy `MyDemo1.java` to `MyDemo3.java`.
> Add a button (`JButton`) to `MyDemo3.java`.
> Make it the default button.
