# Questions and Exercises: Writing Event Listeners

Use this lesson’s tables, the [component
how-to sections](../components/index.html) and the [event
listeners how-to sections](../events/handling.html) to complete these questions and
exercises.

### Questions

> 1. What listener would you implement to be notified when a
> particular component has appeared on screen? What method tells
> you this information?
>
> 2. What listener would you implement to be notified when the
> user has finished editing a text field by pressing Enter? What
> listener would you implement to be notified as each character
> is typed into a text field? Note that you should not implement
> a general- purpose key listener, but a listener specific to text.
>
> 3. What listener would you implement to be notified when a
> spinner’s value has changed? How would you get the spinner’s
> new value?
>
> 4. The default behavior for the focus subsystem is to consume
> the focus traversal keys, such as Tab and Shift Tab. Say you
> want to prevent this from happening in one of your application’s
> components. How would you accomplish this?

### Exercises

> 1. Take the
> [`Beeper.java`](../examples/events/BeeperProject/src/events/Beeper.java)[![(in a .java source file)](../../images/sourceIcon.gif)](../examples/events/BeeperProject/src/events/Beeper.java)
> example and add a text field. Implement it so that when the user
> has finishing entering data, the system beeps.

> example and add a selectable
> component that allows the user to enter a number from 1 to 10.
> For example, you can use a combo box, a set of radio buttons,
> or a spinner. Implement it so that when the user has selected
