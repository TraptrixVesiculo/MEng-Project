# How to Use SpringLayout

---

**Note:** This lesson covers writing layout code by hand, which can be challenging. If you are not interested in learning all the details of layout management, you might prefer to use the `GroupLayout` layout manager combined with a builder tool to lay out your GUI. One such builder tool is the
[NetBeans IDE](../learn/index.html). Otherwise, if you want to code by hand and do not want to use `GroupLayout`, then `GridBagLayout` is recommended as the next most flexible and powerful layout manager.

---

The
[`SpringLayout`](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/SpringLayout.html) class was added in JDK version 1.4
to support layout in GUI builders.
`SpringLayout` is a very flexible layout
manager that can emulate many of the features
of other layout managers. `SpringLayout` is, however, very low-level and as such you really should only use it with a GUI builder, rather than attempting to code a spring layout manager by hand.

This section begins with a simple example showing all the
things you need to remember to create your first spring layout —
and what happens when you forget them!
Later it presents utility methods
that let you lay out components
in a couple of different types of grids.

Here are pictures of some of the layouts we will cover:

![The SpringBox application uses a SpringLayout to produce something similar to what a BoxLayout would produce.](../../figures/uiswing/layout/SpringBox.png)

![The SpringForm application has 5 rows of label-textfield pairs.](../../figures/uiswing/layout/SpringForm.png)

![The SpringCompactGrid application presents components in a grid without forcing all components to be the same size..](../../figures/uiswing/layout/SpringCompactGrid.png)

### How Spring Layouts Work

> Spring layouts do their job by defining directional relationships, or *constraints*, between the
> edges of components. For example,
> you might define that the left edge of one component
> is a fixed distance (5 pixels, say) from the right edge
> of another component.
>
> In a `SpringLayout`, the position of each edge is dependent on the position of
> just one other edge. If a constraint is subsequently added to create a new
> binding for an edge, the previous binding is discarded and the edge remains
> dependent on a single edge.
>
> Unlike many layout managers, `SpringLayout` does not automatically set the
> location of the components it manages. If you hand-code a GUI that uses
> `SpringLayout`, remember to initialize component locations by constraining the west/east and north/south locations.
> Depending on the constraints you use, you may also need to set the size of the
> container explicitly.
>
> Components define *edge* properties, which are connected by `Spring` instances. Each spring has four properties —
> its *minimum*,
> *preferred*, and
> *maximum* values,
> and its actual (current) *value*.
> The springs associated with each component
> are collected into a `SpringLayout.Constraints` object.
>
> An instance of the `Spring` class holds three properties that characterize its
> behavior: the minimum, preferred, and maximum values. Each of these properties
> may be involved in defining its fourth, value, property based on a series of rules.
>
> An instance of the `Spring` class can be visualized as a mechanical spring that provides a corrective force as the spring is compressed or stretched away from
> its preferred value. This force is modelled as linear function of the distance
> from the preferred value, but with two different constants -- one for the
> compressional force and one for the tensional one. Those constants are specified
> by the minimum and maximum values of the spring such that a spring at its
> minimum value produces an equal and opposite force to that which is created when
> it is at its maximum value. The difference between the preferred and minimum
> values, therefore, represents the ease with which the spring can be compressed.
> The difference between its maximum and preferred values indicates the ease
> with which the `Spring` can be extended.
>
> Based on this, a `SpringLayout` can be visualized as a set of objects that are connected by a set of springs on their edges.

### Example: SpringDemo

> This section takes you through the typical steps of
> specifying the constraints for a container that uses
> `SpringLayout`.
> The first example,
> [`SpringDemo1.java`](../examples/layout/SpringDemo1Project/src/layout/SpringDemo1.java),
> is an extremely simple application that features
> a label and a text field
> in a content pane controlled by a spring layout.
> Here is the relevant code:
>
> ```
>
> public class SpringDemo1 {
>     public static void main(String[] args) {
>         ...
>         Container contentPane = frame.getContentPane();
>         SpringLayout layout = new SpringLayout();
>         contentPane.setLayout(layout);
>         contentPane.add(new JLabel("Label: "));
>         contentPane.add(new JTextField("Text field", 15));
>         ...
>         frame.pack();
>         frame.setVisible(true);
>     }
> }
>
> ```
>
> Click the Launch button to run SpringDemo1 using
> [Java™ Web Start](http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/index.jsp) ([download JDK 6](http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp)).
> Alternatively, to compile and run the example yourself,
> consult the
> [example index](../examples/layout/index.html#SpringDemo1).
>
> [![Launches the SpringDemo1 example](../../images/jws-launch-button.png)](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorialJWS/uiswing/layout/ex6/SpringDemo1.jnlp)
>
> Here is what the GUI looks like when it first comes up:
>
> ![SpringDemo1 -- the parent has no initial size!](../../figures/uiswing/layout/SpringDemo1.png)
>
> Here is what it looks like when it is resized to be bigger:
>
> ![SpringDemo1 -- all the components are at (0, 0)!](../../figures/uiswing/layout/SpringDemo1-resized.png)
>
> Obviously, we have some problems.
> Not only does the frame come up way too small,
> but even when it is resized the components are all
> located at (0,0).
> This happens because we have set no springs
> specifying the components' positions
> and the width of the container.
> One small consolation is that at least the components
> are at their preferred sizes —
> we get that for free from the default springs
> created by `SpringLayout`
> for each component.
>
> Our next example,
> [`SpringDemo2.java`](../examples/layout/SpringDemo2Project/src/layout/SpringDemo2.java),
> improves the situation a bit by specifying
> locations for each component.Click the Launch button to run SpringDemo2 using
> [Java™ Web Start](http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/index.jsp) ([download JDK 6](http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp)).

>
> In this example, we will specify that the components
> should appear in a single row,
> with 5 pixels between them.
> The following code specifies the location
> of the label:
>
> ```
>
> //Adjust constraints for the label so it's at (5,5).
> layout.putConstraint(SpringLayout.WEST, label,
>                      5,
>                      SpringLayout.WEST, contentPane);
> layout.putConstraint(SpringLayout.NORTH, label,
>                      5,
>                      SpringLayout.NORTH, contentPane);
>
> ```
>
> The first `putConstraint` call
> specifies that the label's left (west) edge
> should be 5 pixels from its container's left edge.
> This translates to an *x* coordinate of 5.
> The second `putConstraint` call
> sets up a similar relationship between the top
> (north) edges
> of the label and its container,
> resulting in a *y* coordinate of 5.
>
> Here is the code that sets up the location
> of the text field:
>
> ```
>
> //Adjust constraints for the text field so it's at
> //(<label's right edge> + 5, 5).
> layout.putConstraint(SpringLayout.WEST, textField,
>                      5,
>                      SpringLayout.EAST, label);
> layout.putConstraint(SpringLayout.NORTH, textField,
>                      5,
>                      SpringLayout.NORTH, contentPane);
>
> ```
>
> The first `putConstraint` call
> makes the text field's left (west) edge
> be 5 pixels away from the label's right (east) edge.
> The second `putConstraint` call
> is just like the second call in the first snippet,
> and has the same effect of setting the
> component's *y* coordinate to 5.
>
> The previous example still has the problem of
> the container coming up too small.
> But when we resize the window, the components are
> in the right place:
>
> ![SpringDemo2 -- at least now all the components are in the right position!](../../figures/uiswing/layout/SpringDemo2-resized.png)
>
> To make the container initially appear at the right size,
> we need to set the springs that define the right
> (east) and bottom (south) edges
> of the container itself. No constraints for the right and bottom container edges are set by default. The size of the container is defined by setting these constraints.
> [`SpringDemo3.java`](../examples/layout/SpringDemo3Project/src/layout/SpringDemo3.java)
> shows how to do this. Click the Launch button to run SpringDemo3 using
> [Java™ Web Start](http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/index.jsp) ([download JDK 6](http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp)).

>
> [![Launches the SpringDemo3 example](../../images/jws-launch-button.png)](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorialJWS/uiswing/layout/ex6/SpringDemo3.jnlp)
>
> Here is the code that sets the container's springs:
>
> ```
>
> layout.putConstraint(SpringLayout.EAST, contentPane,
>                      5,
>                      SpringLayout.EAST, textField);
> layout.putConstraint(SpringLayout.SOUTH, contentPane,
>                      5,
>                      SpringLayout.SOUTH, textField);
>
> ```
>
> The first `putConstraint` call
> makes the container's right edge be 5 pixels
> to the right of the text field's right edge.
> The second one makes its bottom edge be 5 pixels beyond
> the bottom edge of the tallest component
> (which, for simplicity's sake,
> we've assumed is the text field).
>
> Finally, the window comes up at the right size:
>
> ![SpringDemo3 -- the parent now HAS a correct initial size!](../../figures/uiswing/layout/SpringDemo3.png)
>
> When we make the window larger we can see the spring layout in action,
> distributing the extra space between the available components.
>
> ![SpringDemo3 enlarged](../../figures/uiswing/layout/SpringDemo3-resized.png)
>
> In this case the spring layout has chosen to give all the extra space
> to the text field.
> Although it seems like the spring layout
> treats labels and text fields differently,
> spring layout has no
> special knowledge of any Swing or AWT components.
> It relies on the values of a component's
> minimum, preferred, and maximum size properties.
> The next section discusses how spring layout uses these properties,
> and why they can cause uneven space distribution.

### Springs and Component Size

> A `SpringLayout` object automatically
> installs `Spring`s for
> the height and width of each component
> that the `SpringLayout` controls.
> These springs are essentially covers for
> the components
> `getMinimumSize`,
> `getPreferredSize`,
> and `getMaximumSize` methods.
> By "covers" we mean that
> not only are the springs *initialized*
> with the appropriate values from these methods,
> but also that the springs *track* those values.
> For example, the `Spring` object
> that represents the width of a component
> is a special kind of spring
> that simply delegates its implementation
> to the relevant size methods of the component.
> That way the spring stays in sync with the size methods
> as the characteristics of the component change.
>
> When a component's `getMaximumSize` and
> `getPreferredSize` methods
> return the same value,
> `SpringLayout` interprets this as meaning that
> the component should not be stretched.
> `JLabel` and `JButton`
> are examples of components implemented this way.
> For this reason,
> the label in the SpringDemo3 example
> does not stretch.
>
> The `getMaximumSize` method
> of some components, such as `JTextField`,
> returns the value `Integer.MAX_VALUE`
> for the width and height of its maximum size,
> indicating that the component can grow to any size.
> For this reason,
> when the SpringDemo3 window is enlarged,
> `SpringLayout` distributes all the extra space
> to the only springs that can grow —
> those determining the size of the text field.

### More About the SpringLayout API

> The SpringDemo examples used the `SpringLayout`
> method `putConstraint`
> to set the springs associated with each component.
> The `putConstraint` method is
> a convenience method
> that lets you modify a component's constraints
> without needing to use the full spring layout API.
> Here, again, is the code from `SpringDemo3`
> that sets the location of the label:
>
> ```
>
> layout.putConstraint(SpringLayout.WEST, label,
>                      5,
>                      SpringLayout.WEST, contentPane);
> layout.putConstraint(SpringLayout.NORTH, label,
>                      5,
>                      SpringLayout.NORTH, contentPane);
>
> ```
>
> Here is equivalent code that uses the
> `SpringLayout.Constraints`
> and `Spring` classes directly:

>
> SpringLayout.Constraints  contentPaneCons = 
> 	layout.getConstraints(contentPane);
> contentPaneCons.setX(Spring.sum(Spring.constant(5),
>                           contentPaneCons
>                           .getConstraint(SpringLayout.WEST)));
> contentPaneCons.setY(Spring.sum(Spring.constant(5),
>                           contentPaneCons
>                           .getConstraint(SpringLayout.NORTH)));

> As the preceding snippets imply,

> for describing springs.
> The `SpringLayout` API uses edges to define its constraints. Springs connect edges to establish linear relations between them. Edges are defined by components, using the following constants:
>
> * `SpringLayout.NORTH` specifies the top edge of a component's bounding rectangle.* `SpringLayout.SOUTH` specifies the bottom edge of a component's bounding rectangle.* `SpringLayout.EAST` specifies the right edge of a component's bounding rectangle.* `SpringLayout.WEST` specifies the left edge of a component's bounding rectangle.* `SpringLayout.BASELINE` specifies the baseline of a component.* `SpringLayout.HORIZONTAL_CENTER` specifies the horizontal center of a component's bounding rectangle.* `SpringLayout.VERTICAL_CENTER` specifies the vertical center of a component's bounding rectangle.
>
> Edges differ from `Spring` objects
> The `SpringLayout.Constraints` class
> knows about edges,
> but only has `Spring` objects
> for the following properties:
>
> * *x** *y** *width** *height*
>
> Each `Constraints` object maintains
> the following relationships between its springs
> and the edges they represent:
>
> ```
>  west = x
> north = y
>  east = x + width
> south = y + height
> ```

### Utility Methods for Grids

> Because the `SpringLayout` class
> was created for GUI builders,
> setting up individual springs for a layout
> can be cumbersome to code by hand.
> This section presents a couple of methods
> you can use to install all the springs needed
> to lay out a group of components in a grid.
> These methods emulate some of the features of the
> `GridLayout`,
> `GridBagLayout`, and
> `BoxLayout` classes.
>
> The two methods, called
> `makeGrid` and
> `makeCompactGrid`,
> are defined in
> [`SpringUtilities.java`](../examples/layout/SpringGridProject/src/layout/SpringUtilities.java).
> Both methods work
> by grouping the components together into rows and columns
> and using the `Spring.max` method
> to make a width or height spring
> that makes a row or column
> big enough for all the components in it.
> In the
> `makeCompactGrid`
> method the same width or height spring
> is used for all components in a particular
> column or row, respectively.
> In the
> `makeGrid` method, by contrast,
> the width and height springs are shared
> by every component in the container,
> forcing them all to be the same size. Furthermore, factory methods are provided by
> [`Spring`](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/Spring.html)
> for creating different kinds of springs, including springs that depend on other springs.
>
> Let us see these methods in action.
> Our first example,
> implemented in the source file
> [`SpringGrid.java`](../examples/layout/SpringGridProject/src/layout/SpringGrid.java), displays a bunch of numbers in text fields.
> The center text field is much wider than the others.
> Just as with `GridLayout`,
> having one large cell
> forces all the cells to be equally large. Click the Launch button to run SpringGrid using
> [Java™ Web Start](http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/index.jsp) ([download JDK 6](http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp)).

>     JTextField textField = new JTextField(Integer.toString(i));
>     ...//when i==4, put long text in the text field...
>     panel.add(textField);
> }
> ...
> SpringUtilities.makeGrid(panel,
>                          3, 3, //rows, cols

>                          5, 5);//xPad, yPad
>
> ```
>

### The SpringLayout API

> The API for using `SpringLayout`
> is spread across three classes:
>
> * [`SpringLayout`* [`SpringLayout.Constraints`* [`Spring`](#Spring)](#SpringLayout.Constraints)](#SpringLayout)
>
> SpringLayout
>
> | Constructor or Method | Purpose |
> | [SpringLayout()](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/SpringLayout.html#SpringLayout()) | Create a `SpringLayout` instance. |
> | [SpringLayout.Constraints getConstraints(Component)](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/SpringLayout.html#getConstraints(java.awt.Component)) | Get the constraints (set of springs) associated with the specified component. |
> | [Spring getConstraint(String, Component)](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/SpringLayout.html#getConstraint(java.lang.String, java.awt.Component)) | Get the spring for an edge of a component. The first argument specifies the edge and must be one of the following `SpringLayout` constants: `NORTH`, `SOUTH`, `EAST`, or `WEST`. |
> | [void putConstraint(String, Component, int, String, Component)](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/SpringLayout.html#putConstraint(java.lang.String, java.awt.Component, int, java.lang.String, java.awt.Component))  [void putConstraint(String, Component, Spring, String, Component)](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/SpringLayout.html#putConstraint(java.lang.String, java.awt.Component, javax.swing.Spring, java.lang.String, java.awt.Component)) | Convenience methods for defining relationships between the edges of two components. The first two arguments specify the first component and its affected edge. The last two arguments specify the second component and its affected edge. The third argument specifies the spring that determines the distance between the two. When the third argument is an integer, a constant spring is created to provide a fixed distance between the component edges. |
>
> SpringLayout.Constraints
>
> | Constructor or Method | Purpose |
> | [SpringLayout.Constraints()](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/SpringLayout.Constraints.html#SpringLayout.Constraints())  [SpringLayout.Constraints(Spring, Spring)](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/SpringLayout.Constraints.html#SpringLayout.Constraints(javax.swing.Spring, javax.swing.Spring))  [SpringLayout.Constraints(Spring, Spring, Spring, Spring)](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/SpringLayout.Constraints.html#SpringLayout.Constraints(javax.swing.Spring, javax.swing.Spring, javax.swing.Spring, javax.swing.Spring)) | Create a `SpringLayout.Constraints` instance. The first two arguments, if present, specify the X and Y springs, respectively. The second two arguments, if present, specify the height and width springs, respectively. Omitting an argument causes the corresponding spring to be `null`, which `SpringLayout` generally replaces with suitable defaults. |
> | [Spring getConstraint(String)](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/SpringLayout.Constraints.html#getConstraint(java.lang.String))  [Spring getHeight()](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/SpringLayout.Constraints.html#getHeight())  [Spring getWidth()](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/SpringLayout.Constraints.html#getWidth())  [Spring getX()](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/SpringLayout.Constraints.html#getX())  [Spring getY()](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/SpringLayout.Constraints.html#getY())  [void setConstraint(String, Spring)](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/SpringLayout.Constraints.html#setConstraint(java.lang.String, javax.swing.Spring))  [void setHeight(Spring)](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/SpringLayout.Constraints.html#setHeight(javax.swing.Spring))  [void setWidth(Spring)](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/SpringLayout.Constraints.html#setWidth(javax.swing.Spring))  [void setX(Spring)](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/SpringLayout.Constraints.html#setX(javax.swing.Spring))  [void setY(Spring)](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/SpringLayout.Constraints.html#setY(javax.swing.Spring)) | Get or set the specified spring. The string argument to the `getConstraint` and `setConstraint` methods specifies an edge name, and must be one of the `SpringLayout` constants `NORTH`, `SOUTH`, `EAST`, or `WEST`. |
>
> Spring
>
> | Method | Purpose |
> | [static Spring constant(int)](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/Spring.html#constant(int))  [static Spring constant(int, int, int)](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/Spring.html#constant(int, int, int)) | Create a spring that does not track a component's sizes. The three-argument version creates a spring with its minimum, preferred, and maximum values set to the specified values, in that order. The one-argument version creates a spring with its minimum, preferred, and maximum values all set to the specified integer. Despite the name, springs returned by `constant` are mutable. To make a layout work out, `SpringLayout` might be forced to adjust a "constant" spring. For this reason, you should avoid reusing constant springs unless (1) you truly want the springs to always be precisely alike and (2) other springs provide some flexibility in the layout. |
> | [static Spring sum(Spring, Spring)](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/Spring.html#sum(javax.swing.Spring, javax.swing.Spring))  [static Spring max(Spring, Spring)](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/Spring.html#max(javax.swing.Spring, javax.swing.Spring))  [static Spring minus(Spring)](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/Spring.html#minus(javax.swing.Spring)) | Create a spring that is the result of some mathematical manipulation. The `sum` method adds two springs. The `max` method returns a spring whose value is always greater than or equal to the values of the two arguments. The `minus` method returns a spring running in the opposite direction of the argument. The `minus` method can be used to create an argument for the `sum` method, allowing you to get the difference between two springs. |
> | [int getMinimumValue()](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/Spring.html#getMinimumValue())  [int getPreferredValue()](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/Spring.html#getPreferredValue())  [int getMaximumValue()](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/Spring.html#getMaximumValue()) | Get the corresponding value from the spring. For a `SpringLayout`-created spring that automatically tracks a component, these methods result in calls to the component's corresponding `getXxxSize` method. || [int getValue()](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/Spring.html#getValue())  [setValue(int)](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/Spring.html#setValue(int)) | Get or set the spring's current value. |

> | [`SpringBox`](../examples/layout/index.html#SpringBox) | This page | Uses `SpringLayout` and `makeCompactGrid` to demonstrate laying out a single row of components, and what happens when no springs can grow. |
> | [`SpinnerDemo`](../components/../examples/components/index.html#SpinnerDemo) | [How to Use Spinners](../components/spinner.html) | Uses `SpringLayout` and `makeCompactGrid` to lay out rows of label-spinner pairs. |
> | [`TextInputDemo`](../components/../examples/components/index.html#TextInputDemo) | [How to Use Formatted Text Fields](../components/formattedtextfield.html) | Uses `SpringLayout` and `makeCompactGrid` to lay out rows of labeled components.
