# Lesson: Writing Event Listeners

[Examples Index](../examples/events/index.html)

This lesson gives you details about writing event listeners.
You might not need to read this section.
Your first source of information for event should be the how-to section for the component in question.
You can find the appropriate section using the
[A Visual Guide to Swing Components (Java Look and Feel)](../../ui/features/components.html).
Each component's section shows code
for handling the events most commonly needed
when implementing the component.
For example,
[How to Use Check Boxes](../components/button.html#checkbox) shows you how to handle mouse clicks on check boxes
using an item listener.

### [Some Simple Event-Handling Examples](intro.html)

> The programs in this section illustrate
> events and event handling.

### [General Information about Writing Event Listeners](generalrules.html)

> This section provides information that is useful for handling all types of events.
> One of the topics includes information on using adapters and inner classes to implement event handlers.

### [Listeners Supported by Swing Components](eventsandcomponents.html)

> This is *the* place to find out which Swing components
> can fire which kinds of events.
> You might want to bookmark this section
> so you can easily find
> its quick-reference table.

### [Implementing Listeners for Commonly Handled Events](handling.html)

> This section has
> detailed information and examples
> of writing each common kind of event listener.

### [Listener API Table](api.html)

> This section features
> a quick-reference table that
> shows each listener,
> its adapter class (if any),
> and its methods.

### [Solving Common Event-Handling Problems](problems.html)

> If you are having some hard-to-debug problems related to
> handling events, you might find the solution here.

### [Questions and Exercises](../QandE/questions-ch5.html)

> Try these questions and exercises to test what you have learned in this lesson.
