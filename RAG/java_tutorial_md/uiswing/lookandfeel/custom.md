# Changing the Look of Nimbus

One of the biggest advantages of Nimbus is that it is highly
customizable. You can change the look in almost any way you
can imagine. You can use three primary techniques to
modify the look of Nimbus:

* [Resizing a component](size.html) – Under Nimbus, components are available in three additional
  sizes: mini, small, and large.* [Changing the color theme](color.html) – You can change any of the colors used in the Nimbus
    look and feel.* Skinning a component
      – You have full control over how a component is rendered.
      Skinning, or customizing the look of, a component is beyond the scope
      of this tutorial. See
      [For More Information](info.html) for useful links.
