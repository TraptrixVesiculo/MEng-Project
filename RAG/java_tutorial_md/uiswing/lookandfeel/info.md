  You can run Laffy, download the source, and contribute back

  [java.net](http://java.net/).

  * SwingSet3 is the latest demo that
    shows the rich functionality of Swing. If you are not familiar
    with SwingSet3, it is well worth checking out.
    This latest version uses the Nimbus look and feel.

      * Jasper Potts, one of the Nimbus
        designers, has an informative blog,
