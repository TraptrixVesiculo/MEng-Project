# Lesson: Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations

The Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) standard defines mechanisms for addressing XML data
(XPath) and for specifying transformations on the data in order to convert it
into other forms. JAXP includes an interpreting implementation of XSLT.

In this lesson, you will write out a Document Object Model as
an XML file, and you will see how to generate a DOM from
an arbitrary data file in order to convert it to XML. Finally, you
will convert XML data into a different form, learning about the XPath addressing
mechanism along the way.
