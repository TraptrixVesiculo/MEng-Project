# Lesson: Streaming API for XML

This lesson focuses on the Streaming API for XML (StAX), a streaming Java
technology-based,
event-driven, pull-parsing API for reading and writing XML documents. StAX enables you to
create bidrectional XML parsers that are fast, relatively easy to program, and have
a light memory footprint.
