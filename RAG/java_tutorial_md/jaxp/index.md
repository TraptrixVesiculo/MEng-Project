# Trail: Java API for XML Processing (JAXP)

The **Java API for XML Processing (JAXP)** trail provides an introduction to
Java API for XML Processing (JAXP) 1.4 technology, via examples of
JAXP applications.

## Before You Read This Tutorial

To make full use of the information in the Java API for XML Processing
(JAXP) Tutorial, you should have knowledge of the following technology:

* The Java programming language and its development environment.* The eXtensible Mark-up Language (XML)* The Document Object Model (DOM), as defined by the World Wide
      Web Consortium (W3C) DOM Working Group.* Simple API for XML (SAX), as developed cooperatively by the members
        of the XML-DEV mailing list.

Some prior knowledge of DOM and SAX is assumed. Only code that is
specific to the JAXP API is examined in detail in this tutorial.

Introduction to JAXP](intro/index.html)
provides a brief description of the JAXP technology, including its purpose
and principal features.

[![Trail icon](../images/networkingIcon.gif)
Simple API for XML](sax/index.html)
introduces a concept used in the JAXP technology,
the Simple API for XML (SAX): when to use SAX, how to parse an XML
file, how to implement SAX validation, how to run the SAX parser,
and how to handle lexical events. Links for further information
are provided.

Document Object Model](dom/index.html)
introduces the tree structure used by the
Document Object Model (DOM) and shows you how to use the DOM
functions to create nodes, remove nodes, change the contents
of the nodes, and to traverse the node hierarchy.

[![Trail icon](../images/networkingIcon.gif)
Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations](xslt/index.html)
includes information on how to write a Document Object Model as an XML file,
and how to generate a DOM from an arbitrary data file in order to convert it
to XML.

[![Trail icon](../images/networkingIcon.gif)
Streaming API for XML](stax/index.html)
focuses a streaming Java technology-based, event-driven, pull-parsing
API for reading and writing XML documents. StAX enables you to create
bidirectional XML parsers that are fast, relatively easy to program, and
have a light memory footprint.
