# Lesson: Document Object Model

This lesson presents the Document Object Model (DOM). A DOM is a
standard tree structure, where each node contains one of the components from an
XML structure. The two most common types of nodes are element nodes and
text nodes. Using DOM functions lets you create nodes, remove nodes, change their
contents, and traverse the node hierarchy.

The examples in this lesson demonstrate how to parse an existing XML file
to construct a DOM, display and inspect the DOM hierarchy, and explore the
syntax of namespaces. It also shows how to create a DOM from
scratch, and see how to use some of the implementation-specific features in Sun's
JAXP implementation to convert an existing data set to XML.
