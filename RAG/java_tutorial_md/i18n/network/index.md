# Lesson: Internationalization of Network Resources

In a modern Internet community, many users are no longer satisfied with using
only ASCII symbols to identify a domain name or a web resource. For example,
they would like to be able to register a new domain using their native
characters in Arabic or Chinese or to define a new URI using Unicode characters.
That is why the internationalization of network resources is a cornerstone in
widening horizons for the World Wide Web.

This lesson describes the internationalization of the network resources Domain
Name and Resource Identifier.

### [Internationalized Domain Name](idn.html)

> This section explains how to perform a mapping between Unicode domain name and
> its ASCII form.

### [Internationalized Resource Identifier](iri.html)

> This section shows how to use the mapping methods of the `URI` class to convert
> between an IRI and a URI.
