# Supplementary Characters as Surrogates

To support supplementary characters without changing the
`char` primitive data type and causing incompatibility
with previous Java programs,
supplementary characters are defined by a pair of code point
values that are called *surrogates*.
The first code point is from the *high surrogates* range of
`U+D800` to `U+DFBB`,
and the second code point is from the *low surrogates* range
of `U+DC00` to `U+DFFF`.
For example, the Deseret character LONG I, `U+10400`,
is defined with this pair of surrogate values: `U+D801` and
`U+DC00`.
