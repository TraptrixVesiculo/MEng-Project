# A Quick Example

If you're new to internationalizing software, this lesson is for you.
This lesson uses a simple example to demonstrate how to
internationalize a program so that it displays text messages in the
appropriate language. You'll learn how `Locale` and
`ResourceBundle` objects work together and how to use
properties files.

### [Before Internationalization](before.html)

> The first version of the source code contained hardcoded
> English versions of the messages we want to display.
> This is NOT how you write internationalized software.

### [After Internationalization](after.html)

> This is a sneak preview of what our source code will look like
> after internationalization.

### [Running the Sample Program](run.html)

> To run the sample program, you specify the language and country
> on the command line. This section shows you a few examples.

### [Internationalizing the Sample Program](steps.html)

> Internationalizing the program required just a few steps.
> You'll be surprised at how easy it was.
