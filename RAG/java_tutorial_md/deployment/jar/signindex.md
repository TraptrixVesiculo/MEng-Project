# Signing and Verifying JAR Files

You can optionally sign a JAR file with your electronic "signature."
Users who verify your signature can grant your JAR-bundled software
security privileges that it wouldn't ordinarily have. Conversely,
you can verify the signatures of signed JAR files that you want to use.

This lesson shows you how to use the tools provided in the
Java™ Development Kit to sign and
verify JAR files:

## [Understanding Signing and Verification](intro.html)

If you're not familiar with the concepts of signing and verification,
this section will help to bring you up to speed. It contains definitions
of the relevant terms, explanations of some of the benefits provided by
signing, and an outline of the signing mechanism used by the Java platform
as it relates to JAR files.

## [Signing JAR Files](signing.html)

In this section, you'll learn how to use the
JDK™ tools to digitally
sign your JAR files.

## [Verifying Signed JAR Files](verify.html)

This section shows you how to use the JDK tool set to verify
signed JAR files.
