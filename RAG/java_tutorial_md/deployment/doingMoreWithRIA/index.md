# Lesson: Doing More With Rich Internet Applications

Applets launched by using the Java Network Launch Protocol (JNLP) have
capabilities similar
to those of Java Web Start applications. This lesson contains topics common to the
development and deployment of applets and Java Web Start applications
(together known as rich Internet applications). If you are
unfamiliar with applets or Java Web Start applications, you can learn more in the
following lessons of the Java Tutorials:

* To learn more about applet development and deployment, visit the
  [Applets](../../deployment/applet/index.html) lesson.
* To learn more about the development and deployment of Java Web Start
  applications, visit the
  [Java Web Start](../../deployment/webstart/index.html) lesson.

**Note:** Please make sure you have at least [Java SE Development Kit (JDK) 6 update 10](http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp) release on your client machine before proceeding further. You will need this to view the sample rich internet applications and read subsequent sections without interruptions.
