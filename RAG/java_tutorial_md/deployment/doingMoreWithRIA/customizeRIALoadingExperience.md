# Customizing the Loading Experience

Rich Internet applications (RIAs) may take a few seconds to load depending on
factors such as network speed and resources required by the RIA. Customize
the RIA loading experience by providing a splash screen or a customized
loading progress indicator to engage the end user during the loading process and
to communicate measurable progress information.

While the overall mechanisms to customize the loading experience for
applets and Java Web Start applications are similar, there are subtle differences
in syntax and implementation. See the following topics for step-by-step instructions and
conceptual information about customizing the RIA loading experience:

* [Customizing the Loading Screen](../../deployment/deploymentInDepth/customizeLoadingScreen.html)
* [Displaying a Customized Loading Progress Indicator](../../deployment/applet/customProgressIndicatorForApplet.html) for an applet
* [Displaying a Customized Loading Progress Indicator](../../deployment/webstart/customProgressIndicatorForAppln.html) for a Java Web Start application
* [Customizing the Rich Internet Application Loading Experience](http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/customizeRIALoadingExperience.html) (conceptual information, client Java Runtime Environment (JRE) software capabilities)
