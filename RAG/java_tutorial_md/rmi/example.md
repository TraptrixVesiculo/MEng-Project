# Compiling and Running the Example

Now that the code for the compute engine example has been written,
it needs to be compiled and run.

[Compiling the Example Programs](compiling.html)
> In this section, you learn how to compile the server and the client
> programs that make up the compute engine example.

[Running the Example Programs](running.html)
> Finally, you run the server and client programs and consequently
> compute the value of
> ![the pi symbol](../figures/rmi/pi.gif ).
