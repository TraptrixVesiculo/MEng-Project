# Trail: JavaBeans(TM)

JavaBeans™ is a portable, platform-independent component model
written in the Java programming language. The JavaBeans architecture
was built through a collaborative industry effort and enables
developers to write reusable components in the Java programming
language.

With the JavaBeans API you can
create reuseable, platform-independent components. Using
JavaBeans-compliant application builder tools,
you can combine these components into applets,
applications, or composite components.

JavaBean components are known as *beans*. Beans are dynamic in that
they can be changed or customized.
Through the design mode of a builder tool, you use the property sheet
or bean customizer to customize the bean and then save (persist)
your customized beans.

This trail is represented in the following lessons:

[![Trail icon](../images/internatsm.GIF)
**JavaBeans Concepts**](whatis/index.html)
describes the basic notion of JavaBeans and what makes a bean.

[![Trail icon](../images/internatsm.GIF)
**Using the NetBeans GUI Builder**](nb/index.html) describes the
NetBeans GUI Builder within the scope of operating with bean objects.

[![Trail icon](../images/internatsm.GIF)
**Writing a Simple Bean**](writingbean/index.html) walks you through creating
a rudimentary bean, saving the bean, adding the bean to the Palette of the
NetBeans GUI Builder and inspecting the bean's properties and
events.

[![Trail icon](../images/internatsm.GIF)
**Bean Properties**](properties/index.html) explains how to give your beans properties:
bean appearance and behavior characteristics that are *customizable at design time*.

[![Trail icon](../images/internatsm.GIF)
**Manipulating Events**](events/index.html) describes the
JavaBeans event manipulating capabilities. If you are not familiar
with event handling, you might want to read up on
[Writing Event Listeners](../uiswing/events/index.html) to prepare for this material.

[![Trail icon](../images/internatsm.GIF)
**Bean Persistence**](persistence/index.html) explains how to save and restore
beans to their customized state.

[![Trail icon](../images/internatsm.GIF)
**Long Term Persistence**](longpersistence/index.html) explains how to save and load
your beans in the XML format using the `XMLDecoder`
and `XMLEncoder` classes.

[![Trail icon](../images/internatsm.GIF)
**Introspection**](introspection/index.html)  describes how methods, properties, and
events are discovered in the beans that you write.

[![Trail icon](../images/internatsm.GIF)
**Bean Customization**](customization/index.html) introduces you to property
editors, and the `Customizer` interface.

[![Trail icon](../images/internatsm.GIF)
**Using the BeanContext API**](beancontext/index.html)
covers The Extensible Runtime Containment and Services Protocol,
also known as beancontext.
