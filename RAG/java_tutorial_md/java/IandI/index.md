# Lesson: Interfaces and Inheritance

### [Interfaces](createinterface.html)

> You saw an example of implementing an interface in the previous
> lesson.
> You can read more about interfaces here—what they are for, why you
> might want to write one, and how to write one.

### [Inheritance](subclasses.html)

> This section describes the way in which you can derive one class from another. That is, how
> a *subclass* can inherit fields and methods from a *superclass*. You will learn that all
> classes are derived from the `Object` class, and how to modify the methods that a
> subclass inherits from superclasses. This section also covers interface-like *abstract classes*.
