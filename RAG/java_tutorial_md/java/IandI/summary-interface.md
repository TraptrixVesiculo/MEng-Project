# Summary of Interfaces

An interface defines a protocol of communication between two
objects.

An interface declaration contains signatures, but no implementations,
for a set of methods, and might also contain constant
definitions.

A class that implements an interface must implement
all the methods declared in the interface.

An interface name can be used anywhere a type can be used.
