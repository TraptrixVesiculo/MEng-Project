# Lesson: Classes and Objects

With the knowledge you now have of the basics of
the Java programming language, you can learn to write your own
classes. In this
lesson,
you will find information
about defining your own classes, including declaring
member variables, methods, and constructors.

You will learn to use your classes to create objects, and how to use the objects you create.

This
lesson
also covers nesting classes
within other classes, enumerations, and annotations.

### [Classes](classes.html)

> This section shows you the anatomy of a class, and how
> to declare fields, methods, and constructors.

### [Objects](objects.html)

> This section covers creating and using objects. You will learn how to instantiate an object, and,
> once instantiated, how to use the `dot` operator to access the object's instance variables and methods.

### [More on Classes](more.html)

> This section covers more aspects of classes that depend on using object references and the `dot` operator
> that you learned about in the preceding section:
> returning values from methods, the `this` keyword, class vs. instance members, and access control.

### [Nested Classes](nested.html)

> Static nested classes, inner classes, anonymous inner
> classes, and local classes are covered.

### [Enum Types](enum.html)

> This section covers enumerations, specialized classes that allow you to define and use sets of constants.

### [Annotations](annotations.html)

> Annotations allow you to add information to your program that is not actually part of the program. This section
> describes three built-in annotations that you should know about.
