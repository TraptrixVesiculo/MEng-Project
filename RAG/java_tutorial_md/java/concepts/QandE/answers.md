# Answers to Questions and Exercises: Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

### Answers to Questions

1. Real-world objects contain **state** and **behavior**.

   - A software object's state is stored in **fields**.

     - A software object's behavior is exposed through **methods**.

       - Hiding internal data from the outside world, and accessing it only through
         publicly exposed methods is known as data **encapsulation**.

         - A blueprint for a software object is called a **class**.

           - Common behavior can be defined in a **superclass** and inherited into a **subclass** using the **extends** keyword.

             - A collection of methods with no implementation is called an **interface**.

               - A namespace that organizes classes and interfaces by functionality is called a **package**.

                 - The term API stands for **Application Programming Interface**.

### Answers to Exercises

1. Your answers will vary depending on the real-world objects that you are modeling.

   - Your answers will vary here as well, but the error message will specifically list the
