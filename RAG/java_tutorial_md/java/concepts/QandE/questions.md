# Questions and Exercises: Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

### Questions

> 1. Real-world objects contain \_\_\_ and \_\_\_.
>
>    - A software object's state is stored in \_\_\_.
>
>      - A software object's behavior is exposed through \_\_\_.
>
>        - Hiding internal data from the outside world, and accessing it only through
>          publicly exposed methods is known as data \_\_\_.
>
>          - A blueprint for a software object is called a \_\_\_.
>
>            - Common behavior can be defined in a \_\_\_ and inherited into a \_\_\_ using the \_\_\_ keyword.
>
>              - A collection of methods with no implementation is called an \_\_\_.
>
>                - A namespace that organizes classes and interfaces by functionality is called a \_\_\_.
>
>                  - The term API stands for \_\_\_?

### Exercises

> 1. Create new classes for each real-world object that you observed at the beginning of this trail. Refer to the Bicycle class if you forget the required syntax.
>
>    - For each new class that you've created above, create an interface that defines its behavior, then require your class to implement it. Omit one or two methods and try compiling. What does the error look like?
