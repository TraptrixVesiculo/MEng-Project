# Summary of Creating and Using Packages

To create a package for a type, put a `package`
statement as the first statement in the source file that contains the
type (class, interface, enumeration, or annotation type).

To use a public type that's in a different package,
you have three choices: (1) use the fully qualified name
of the type, (2) import the type, or (3) import the entire package of which the
type is a member.

The path names for a package's source and class files mirror the name of the package.

You might have to set your `CLASSPATH` so that the compiler and
the JVM can find the `.class` files for your types.
