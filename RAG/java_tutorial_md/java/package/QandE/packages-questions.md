# Questions and Exercises: Creating and Using Packages

### Questions

> Assume you have written some classes. Belatedly, you
> decide they should be split into three packages, as
> listed in the following table. Furthermore, assume the
> classes are currently in the default package (they have
> no `package` statements).
> > **Destination Packages**
> >
> > | **Package Name** | **Class Name** |
> > | `mygame.server` | `Server` |
> > | `mygame.shared` | `Utilities` |
> > | `mygame.client` | `Client` |
>
> 1. Which line of code will you need to add to each source
>    file to put each class in the right package?
>
>    - To adhere to the directory structure, you will need to
>      create some subdirectories in the development directory
>      and put source files in the correct subdirectories. What
>      subdirectories must you create? Which subdirectory does
>      each source file go in?
>
>      - Do you think you'll need to make any other changes to
>        the source files to make them compile correctly?
>        If so, what?

### Exercises

> Download the source files as listed here.
>
> * [`Client`](question/Client.java)* [`Server`](question/Server.java)* [`Utilities`](question/Utilities.java)
>
> 1. Implement the changes you proposed in questions 1 through 3
>    using the source files you just downloaded.
>
>    - Compile the revised source files. (*Hint:*
>      If you're invoking the compiler from the command line
>      (as opposed to using a builder), invoke the compiler from
>      the directory that contains the `mygame` directory
>      you just created.)
