# Lesson: Numbers and Strings

### [Numbers](numbers.html)

> This section begins with a discussion of the `Number`
> class (in the `java.lang` package) and its subclasses. In particular, this section talks about the
> situations where you would use instantiations of these classes rather than the
> primitive data types. Additionally, this section talks about other classes you might need to work
> with numbers, such as formatting or using mathematical functions to complement the
> operators built into the language.

### [Strings](strings.html)

> Strings, which are widely used in Java programming, are a sequence of characters.
> In the Java programming language, strings are objects. This section describes using the `String`
> class to create and manipulate strings. It also compares the `String` and
> `StringBuilder` classes.
