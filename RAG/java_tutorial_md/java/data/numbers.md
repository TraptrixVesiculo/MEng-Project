# Numbers

This section begins with a discussion of the
[`Number`](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Number.html)
class in the `java.lang` package,
its subclasses, and the
situations where you would use instantiations of these classes rather than the
primitive number types.

This section also presents the
[`PrintStream`](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/PrintStream.html) and
[`DecimalFormat`](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/DecimalFormat.html)
classes, which provide methods for writing formatted numerical output.

Finally, the
[`Math`](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html)
class in `java.lang` is discussed. It contains mathematical functions
to complement the operators built into the language. This class has
methods for the trigonometric functions, exponential functions, and so forth.
