# Control Flow Statements

The statements inside your source files are generally executed from top to bottom, in the order that they appear. *Control flow statements*,
however, break up the flow of execution by employing decision making, looping, and branching, enabling your program to *conditionally* execute
particular blocks of code. This section describes
the decision-making statements (`if-then`, `if-then-else`, `switch`),
the looping statements (`for`, `while`, `do-while`), and the branching statements (`break`, `continue`, `return`) supported by the Java programming language.
