# Questions and Exercises: Control Flow Statements

### Questions

> 1. The most basic control flow statement supported by the Java programming language is the \_\_\_ statement.
>
>    - The \_\_\_ statement allows for any number of possible execution paths.
>
>      - The \_\_\_ statement is similar to the `while` statement,
>        but evaluates its expression at the \_\_\_ of the loop.
>
>        - How do you write an infinite loop using the `for` statement?
>
>          - How do you write an infinite loop using the `while` statement?

### Exercises

> 1. Consider the following code snippet.
>    > ```
>    >
>    > if (aNumber >= 0)
>    >     if (aNumber == 0) System.out.println("first string");
>    > else System.out.println("second string");
>    > System.out.println("third string");
>    >
>    > ```
>
>    - What output do you think the code will produce if `aNumber` is 3?
>
>      - Write a test program containing the previous code snippet;
>        make `aNumber` 3.
>        What is the output of the program?
>        Is it what you predicted?
>        Explain why the output is what it is;
>        in other words, what is the control flow for the code snippet?
>
>        - Using only spaces and line breaks, reformat the code snippet to make
>          the control flow easier to understand.
>
>          - Use braces, { and }, to further clarify the code.
