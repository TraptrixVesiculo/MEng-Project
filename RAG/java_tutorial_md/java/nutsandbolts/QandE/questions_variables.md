# Questions and Exercises: Variables

### Questions

> 1. The term "instance variable" is another name for \_\_\_.
>
>    - The term "class variable" is another name for \_\_\_.
>
>      - A local variable stores temporary state; it is declared inside a \_\_\_.
>
>        - A variable declared within the opening and closing parenthesis of a method
>          signature is called a \_\_\_\_.
>
>          - What are the eight primitive data types supported by the Java programming language?
>
>            - Character strings are represented by the class \_\_\_.
>
>              - An \_\_\_ is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.

### Exercises

> 1. Create a small program that defines some fields. Try creating some illegal field names and see what kind of error the compiler produces. Use the naming rules and conventions as a guide.
>
>    - In the program you created in Exercise 1, try leaving the fields uninitialized and print out
>      their values. Try the same with a local variable and see what kind of
>      compiler errors you can produce. Becoming familiar with common compiler errors
>      will make it easier to recognize bugs in your code.
