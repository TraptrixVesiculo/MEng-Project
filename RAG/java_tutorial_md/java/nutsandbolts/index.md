# Lesson: Language Basics

### [Variables](variables.html)

> You've already learned that objects store their state in fields. However, the Java
> programming language also uses the term "variable" as well. This section discusses
> this relationship, plus variable naming rules and conventions,
> basic data types (primitive types, character strings, and arrays), default values, and literals.

### [Operators](operators.html)

> This section describes the operators of the Java programming language. It presents the most
> commonly-used operators first, and the less commonly-used operators last. Each discussion
> includes code samples that you can compile and run.

### [Expressions, Statements, and Blocks](expressions.html)

> Operators may be used in building expressions, which compute values; expressions are the core components of statements; statements may be grouped into blocks.
> This section discusses expressions, statements, and blocks using example code that you've already
> seen.

### [Control Flow Statements](flow.html)

> This section describes the control flow statements supported by the Java programming language.
> It covers the decisions-making, looping, and branching statements that enable your programs to conditionally
> execute particular blocks of code.
