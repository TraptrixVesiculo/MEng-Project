# Summary of Control Flow Statements

The `if-then` statement is the most basic of
all the control flow statements. It tells your program to execute a certain
section of code *only if* a particular test evaluates to `true`.
The `if-then-else` statement provides a secondary path of execution when an
"if" clause evaluates to `false`.
Unlike `if-then` and `if-then-else`, the `switch` statement allows for any number of
possible execution paths.
The `while` and `do-while` statements continually execute a block of statements
while a particular condition is `true`.
The difference between `do-while` and `while` is
that `do-while` evaluates its expression at the bottom of the loop
instead of the top.
Therefore, the statements within the `do` block are always executed
at least once.
The `for` statement provides a compact way to iterate over a range of
values. It has two forms, one of which was designed for looping through
collections
and arrays.
