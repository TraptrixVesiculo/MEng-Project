# Trail: Learning the Java Language

This trail covers the fundamentals of programming
in the Java programming language.

[![trail icon](../images/javaIcon.gif)
**Object-Oriented Programming Concepts**](concepts/index.html)
teaches you the core concepts behind object-oriented programming:
objects, messages, classes, and inheritance.
This lesson ends by showing you how these concepts
translate into code.
Feel free to skip this lesson
if you are already familiar with object-oriented programming.

**Language Basics**](nutsandbolts/index.html)
describes the traditional features of the language,
including variables, arrays, data types, operators, and control flow.

[![trail icon](../images/javaIcon.gif)
**Classes and Objects**](javaOO/index.html)
describes how to write the classes from which objects are created, and how to create and use the objects.

**Interfaces and Inheritance**](IandI/index.html)
describes interfaces—what they are, why you
would want to write one, and how to write one. This section also describes the way in which you can
derive one class from another. That is, how
a *subclass* can inherit fields and methods from a *superclass*. You will learn that all
classes are derived from the `Object` class, and how to modify the methods that a
subclass inherits from superclasses.

**Numbers and Strings**](data/index.html)
This lesson describes how to use
`Number` and `String` objects
The lesson also shows you how to format data for output.

[![trail icon](../images/javaIcon.gif)
**Generics**](generics/index.html)
are a powerful feature of the Java programming language. They improve the
type safety of your code,
making more of your bugs detectable at compile time.

[![trail icon](../images/javaIcon.gif)
**Packages**](package/index.html)
are a feature of the Java programming language
that help you to organize and structure your classes
and their relationships to one another.
