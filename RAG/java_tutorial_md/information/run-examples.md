# Compiling and Running the Examples: FAQs

* [How do I compile and run the examples?](#q1)* [Why do I get an error message when I try to
    compile or run an example?](#q1a)* [I already have the JRE. Why do I need the JDK?](#q2)* [I'm just not ready to upgrade to JDK 6. Can I
        get the old Tutorials?](#q5)* [Why doesn't Sun provide software for Mac OS X?](#q7).

How do I compile and run the examples?
For instructions, refer to
[The "Hello World!" Application](../getStarted/cupojava/index.html)
lesson in the
[Getting Started](../getStarted/index.html)
trail. This lesson includes links to download the Java SE Development
Kit 6 (also known as JDK™ 6) for Windows, Linux, Solaris, and
Mac OS X. There are also instructions and links for the NetBeans™
IDE, which runs on all the above platforms.

Why do I get an error message when I try to
compile or run an example?
Check out
[Getting Started](../getStarted/problems/index.html).

I already have the JRE. Why do I need the JDK?
The Java SE Runtime Environment, or JRE, allows you to run programs
that have already been compiled and deployed. We hope you will use the
Tutorials to expand your understanding of Java technology by modifying
and extending the examples. To do this, you need the JDK.

I'm just not ready to upgrade to JDK 6. Can I
get the old Tutorials?
You can get the old tutorials from the
[Java Technology
Download page](http://java.sun.com/products/archive/). But note that a
lot of material in the old Tutorials is very out of date, even for
version 5.0 of the platform. You can
actually use the new Tutorials with JDK 5.0; just recompile the
examples. Most of the current examples will recompile without change;
the rest will recompile with minor changes.

Why doesn't Sun provide software for Mac OS X?.
Java platform software for Macintosh OS X is maintained by Apple
Computer; the OS X version of JDK 5.0 is included with the OS.
Apple also provides JDK 6 as Beta software; to download it, go to [connect.apple.com](http://connect.apple.com/). For more
information about the Java platform on Mac OS X, go to [developer.apple.com/java](http://developer.apple.com/java).
