# Questions and Exercises: Implementations

### Questions

> 1. You plan to write a program that uses several basic
>    collection interfaces: `Set`, `List`,
>    `Queue`, and `Map`. You're not sure which
>    implementations will work best, so you decide to use general-purpose
>    implementations until you get a better idea how your program will work
>    in the real world. Which implementations are these?
>
>    - If you need a `Set` implementation that provides value-ordered iteration, which class should you use?
>    - Which class do you use to access wrapper implementations?

### Exercises

> 1. Write a program that reads a text file, specified by the first
>    command line argument, into a `List`. The program
>    should then print random lines from the file, the number of lines
>    printed to be specified by the second command line argument.
>    Write the program so that a correctly-sized collection is
>    allocated all at once, instead of being gradually expanded as the
>    file is read in. Hint: To determine the number of lines in the
>    file, use
>    [`java.io.File.length`](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/File.html#length())
>    to obtain the size of the file, then divide by an assumed size of an
>    average line.
