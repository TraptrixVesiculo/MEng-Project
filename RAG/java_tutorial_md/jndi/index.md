service LDAP is used to demostrate the use of JNDI to access the
directory services.

 **Note:**
This tutorial trail is based on the standalone JNDI tutorial located at
<http://download.oracle.com/javase/jndi/tutorial/>.
The standalone JNDI tutorial,
last updated under Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, v 1.4.2,
provides comprehensive coverage on JNDI, but is no longer supported.
This tutorial excerpts the basics from the standlone tutorial and includes
features added to JNDI
in the Java Platform Standard Edition 5.0 and 6 releases.

The older JNDI tutorial is preserved as an archive on
[download.oracle.com](http://download.oracle.com/javase/jndi/tutorial/).
