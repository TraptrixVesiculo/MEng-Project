# Event and Service Provider Packages

## Event Package

The
[javax.naming.event](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/naming/event/package-summary.html) package
contains classes and interfaces for supporting event notification
in naming and directory services.
Event notification is described in detail in the
trail.

Events
:   A
    [NamingEvent](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/naming/event/NamingEvent.html) represents an event that is generated by a naming/directory service.
    The event contains a *type* that identifies the type of event.
    For example,
    event types are categorized into those that affect the namespace,
    such as "object added," and those that do not, such as "object changed."

Listeners
:   A
    [NamingListener](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/naming/event/NamingListener.html)
    is an object that listens for NamingEvents.
    Each category of event type has a corresponding type of NamingListener.
    For example, a
    [NamespaceChangeListener](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/naming/event/NamespaceChangeListener.html) represents a listener interested in namespace change events and an
    [ObjectChangeListener](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/naming/event/ObjectChangeListener.html) represents a listener interested in object change events.

To receive event notifications, a listener must be registered with either an
[EventContext](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/naming/event/EventContext.html) or an
[EventDirContext](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/naming/event/EventDirContext.html).
Once registered, the listener will receive event notifications when
the corresponding changes occur in the naming/directory service.
The details about Event Notification can be found in the
[JNDI Tutorial](http://java.sun.com/products/jndi/tutorial/beyond/event/index.html) 

## Service Provider Package

The
[javax.naming.spi](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/naming/spi/package-summary.html) package
provides the means by which developers of different
naming/directory service providers can develop and hook up their
implementations so that the corresponding services are accessible from
applications that use the JNDI.

Plug-In Architecture
:   The javax.naming.spi package allows different implementations to be plugged in
    dynamically.
    These implementations include those for the
    [initial context](../../jndi/ops/index.html) and for contexts that can be reached
    from the initial context.:   Java Object Support
        :   The javax.naming.spi package supports
            implementors of [lookup](../../jndi/ops/lookup.html)
            and related methods to return Java objects that are natural
            and intuitive for the Java programmer.
            For example, if you look up a printer name from the directory,
            then you likely would expect to get
            back a printer object on which to operate.
            This support is provided in the form of
            [object factories](../../jndi/objects/index.html#OBJFAC).

            This package also provides support for doing the reverse.
            That is, implementors of
            [Context.bind()](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/naming/Context.html#bind(javax.naming.Name, java.lang.Object))  and related methods can accept Java objects and
            store the objects in a format acceptable to the underlying naming/directory
            service.
            This support is provided in the form of
            [state factories](../../jndi/objects/index.html#STATEFAC).:   Multiple Naming Systems (Federation)
                :   JNDI operations allow applications to supply names that span multiple
                    naming systems. In the process of completing
                    an operation, one service provider might need to interact
                    with another service provider, for example to pass on
                    the operation to be continued in the next naming system.
                    This package provides support for
                    different providers to cooperate to complete JNDI operations.

The details about the Service Provider mechanism can be found in the
[JNDI Tutorial](http://java.sun.com/products/jndi/tutorial/provider/index.html)
