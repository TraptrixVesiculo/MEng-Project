# How Will Java Technology Change My Life?

We can't promise you fame, fortune, or even a job
if you learn the Java programming language.
Still, it is likely to make your programs
better and requires less
effort than other languages. We believe that Java technology
will help you do the
following:

* **Get started quickly**:
  Although the Java programming language is a powerful object-oriented
  language, it's easy to
  learn, especially for programmers already
  familiar with C or C++.

  * **Write less code**:
    Comparisons of program metrics (class counts,
    method counts, and so on)
    suggest that a program written in the Java programming language can be
    four times smaller than
    the same program written in C++.

    * **Write better code**:
      The Java programming language encourages good coding
      practices, and automatic garbage
      collection helps you avoid memory leaks. Its
      object orientation, its
      JavaBeansTM component architecture, and its
      wide-ranging, easily
      extendible API let you reuse existing,
      tested code and introduce
      fewer bugs.

      * **Develop programs more quickly**:
        The Java programming language is simpler than C++, and as such,
        your development time could be up to twice as fast when writing in it.
        Your programs will also require fewer lines of code.

        * **Avoid platform dependencies**:
          You can keep your program portable by avoiding
          the use of libraries
          written in other languages.

          * **Write once, run anywhere**:
            Because applications written in the Java programming language are compiled into
            machine-independent
            bytecodes, they run consistently on any Java
            platform.

            * **Distribute software more easily**:
              With Java Web Start software, users will be able to launch your applications
              with a single click of the mouse.
              An automatic version check at startup ensures that users are always up
              to date with the latest version of your software. If an update is available, the Java Web Start
              software will automatically update their installation.
