# What Can Java Technology Do?

The general-purpose, high-level Java
programming language is a powerful software platform.
Every full implementation of the Java platform gives you the following features:

* **Development Tools**: The development tools
  provide everything you'll need for
  compiling, running, monitoring, debugging, and documenting your applications.
  As a new developer, the main tools you'll be using are the `javac` compiler,
  the `java` launcher, and the `javadoc` documentation tool.
* **Application Programming Interface (API)**: The API provides the core functionality of the Java programming
  language. It offers a wide array of useful classes ready for use
  in your own applications. It spans everything from basic objects,
  to networking and security, to XML generation and database access, and more. The core API is very large; to get an overview of what it contains, consult
  the
  [Java SE Development Kit 6 (JDKTM 6) documentation](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/index.html).
* **Deployment Technologies**: The JDK software provides standard
  mechanisms such as
  the Java Web Start software and Java Plug-In software for deploying your applications to end users.
* **User Interface Toolkits**: The
  Swing and Java 2D toolkits make it possible to create sophisticated
  Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs).
* **Integration Libraries**: Integration libraries
  such as the Java IDL API, JDBC™ API,
  Java Naming and Directory Interface™ (JNDI) API,
  Java RMI, and Java Remote Method Invocation over Internet Inter-ORB Protocol Technology (Java RMI-IIOP Technology) enable database access and manipulation
  of remote objects.
