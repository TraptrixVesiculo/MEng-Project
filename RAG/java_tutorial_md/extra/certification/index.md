# Lesson: Preparation for Java Programmer Language Certification

Sun Microsystems provides certification examinations for Solaris
administrators and different types of Java programmers.
Sun also offers training classes and practice exams for each
type of certification.

Much of the material in this tutorial is pertinent to preparation
for the examination to become
a "Sun Certified Programmer for the Java Platform."

Some useful links are:
> <http://www.sun.com/training/certification>
> :   An overview of all of the various certifications offered and their associated learning tools.
>   
>
> <http://www.sun.com/training/certification/java/index.html>
> :   Information specific to the certifications available for Java technologies.
>   
>
> <http://www.sun.com/training/certification/objectives>
> :   A table of links to the "Testing Objectives" for each Java certification exam—lists of
>     what will be covered on the exams.

If you open the last link and select the Testing Objectives for the
Sun Certified Programmer for the Java Platform, you
will find a list of objectives that includes bulleted items in seven areas:

1. Declarations, Initialization, and Scoping
2. Flow Control
3. API Contents
4. Concurrency
5. OO Concepts
6. Collections/Generics
7. Fundamentals

In the text below, each of the bulleted items in each of the seven
areas of the Testing Objectives for the
Sun Certified Programmer for the Java Platform is quoted,
followed by links to sections in this tutorial that include relevant material.
