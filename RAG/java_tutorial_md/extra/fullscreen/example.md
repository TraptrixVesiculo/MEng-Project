# Examples

---

**Note:** You can only run these examples if you're using Java 2
Standard Edition version 1.4 or higher.

---

> [`CapabilitiesTest`](example-1dot4/CapabilitiesTest.java) demonstrates the
> different buffering capabilities available for the machine on which it
> is run.
>
> [`DisplayModeTest`](example-1dot4/DisplayModeTest.java) shows a Swing application that uses
> passive rendering. If full-screen exclusive mode is available,
> it will enter full-screen exclusive mode. If display mode changes
> are allowed, it allows you to switch between display modes.
>
> [`MultiBufferTest`](example-1dot4/MultiBufferTest.java) enters full-screen
> mode and uses multi-buffering through an active render loop.
